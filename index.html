                Talking about disadvantage in public narratives
            </h1>
            <p class="intro_dek">
                To examine how narratives about disadvantage are presented in the
                Australian media, a team of Monash University researchers analysed
                more than two hundred articles from 2020 and further explored whether
                these narratives differ across different types of disadvantaged
                groups, issues and publishers. The dataset was first human-coded,
                which may help in developing machine learning models to track public
                narratives using artificial intelligence.

                        represnts the frequency that different groups and issues were
                        discussed in the same articles. The height of node represents the
                        frequency of this groups or issues is co-mentioned among all the
                        articles. Hard to understand? Let's start from one article. This
                        article from Fairfox named "Migrant worker deserve state support"
                        metioned Women and Racialminorities groups, while it mainly
                        disscussed Healthcare issues. Therefore, two links from Women and
                        Racialminorities extend to Healthcare. -->

                        new issues: Work, Crime and Prejudice. Thus in total,
                        Racialminorities is co-mentioned four times with other issues
                        among these two articles, and Healthcare is discussed with other

                        to mention Racialminorities a lot. Wait, it's too early to draw
                        conclusions as we're only showing 20 articles. Let's take all the
